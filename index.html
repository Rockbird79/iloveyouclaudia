	<h1>Hey Claudia, I love you so much!!!!!</h1>
	<h2>Welcome to your website!</h2>
	<h3>Here you will find letters that can be directly uploaded and dated for the rest of our lives!!!</h3>
	<h4>June 15th, 2024</h4>
	<p>Today marks the first journal I'll ever write to you, Claudia. I'm sitting here, outside with my dogs, just reflecting on our entire journey. How lucky am I to be able to call you mine! I seriously can't believe it. I know long distance is coming, and if I'm being honest I am NOT looking forward to not being able to softly (or aggressively) kiss your lips and share our passionate hugs. However, I know that God put me in this only because of UPenn, which means that his plan required long distance. So, although it will not always be fun, I physically hurt at the thought of not having you in my life forever. You're the most amazing person ever Claudia, yesterday was my birthday, and you gave me the greatest present I could have ever asked for. I still remember the feeling of opening it for the first time. AGHHHH so nice. I truly see a future with us Claudia, I know that we have such a strong connection and you're truly my one and only true love. This will be the first of many MANY letters here. This took forever to setup hahaha, but it will never erase and we can hold on to it forever. I adore you Claudia, whenever you're away and feel stressed, overwhelmed, ANYTHING, know that I'll always be someone that you can talk to and return home to. I love you.</p>
